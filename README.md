# sustainability-editorial

In April 2023, New York University hosted an opinion essay competition open to students in any New York City college for the 2040 Now climate action initiative. My essay, entitled *Sustainability in Tech: The Missing Link*, discussed how computer scientists and engineers are often excluded from environmental science and sustainability education and initiatives, and what NYU should do to prevent this dangerous exclusion.

This essay was awarded third place overall in the competition. Read the award winning essay here.
